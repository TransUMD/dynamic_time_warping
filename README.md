<h3>Dynamic Time Warping</h3>
<p>
In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in speed. DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restrictions. The sequences are "warped" non-linearly in the time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non-linear variations in the time dimension.

In this script, I use the python package (fastdtw) and apply it to a Energy Usage time series dataset found here: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption" target="_blank">UCI Machine Learning - Individual household electric power consumption Data Set </a>
